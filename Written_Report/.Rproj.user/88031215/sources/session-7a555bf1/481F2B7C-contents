# Coding for the Financial Econometrics Essay on Risk Parity Portfolios

In this markdown folder I will explain my thinking and working for the coding aspect of the Financial Econometrics essay submitted in January 2025. I will talk through the coding done to get the results represented in the written report of this essay

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list = ls()) # Clean your environment:
gc()
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, riskParityPortfolio, xts, quadprog, tbl2xts, PerformanceAnalytics,
               RColorBrewer, knitr, kableExtra)

setwd("~/Masters_2024_stuff/Financial_Econometrics/Fin_Metrics_Project")
list.files('Written_Report/code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% .[grepl('.R', .)] %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))
```

## Packages

What follows is the list of packages that have been used throughout the functions of this project:

* tidyverse (includes ggplot2, dplyr)
* Texevier
* fmxdat
* PerformanceAnalytics
* tbl2xts
* kableExtra
* RColorBrewer
* riskParityPortfolio
* quadprog

## Setting up the Data

```{r}
Data <- Data_Setup()

LCL_Index_dat <- Data[[2]]
Rebal_Days <- Data[[3]]
```

The Data_Setup function takes the data folders provider by the administrator of the module and reads them into data frames. The Stock specific daily data for the JSE is adapted to only include the current top 40 stocks listed on the exchange. The index specific data is filtered for all indices that are relevant to constructing the portfolio, as referenced in the written report. The mean of the short-term fixed-interest assets across the sample is used as the risk free rate, this is used later in the Maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio.

This function then returns a list variable that includes the data of the stocks, indices and relevant rebalance dates that can be referenced at later points.

## Assets Portfolios Construction

```{r}
Sector_Plots <- Sector_Risk_Parity(data = LCL_Index_dat, rebal = Rebal_Days)
```

Here the data from the initial function is parsed to the Sector_Risk_Parity function to construct and plot relevant aspects of the portfolios. The first thing that is done in this function is to impute the missing values of the indices that have starting points after other indices. This is a seperate function called impute_missing_returns that, when used with the specifics that I have, will draw the replacement values from the distribution of that specific variable.
