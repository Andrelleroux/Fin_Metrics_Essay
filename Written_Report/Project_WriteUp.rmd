# Introduction 



# Data 

Data for this project was collected largely from ourworldindata.org, original sources are cited in the
bibliography. The following data is pooled.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Annual level of carbon emissions by country.
  \item When or if each country implemented a carbon tax.
  \item The annual GDP per capita for each country.
  \item The land area for each country in kilometers.
  \item The population of each country in millions.
  \item The Human Development Index (HDI) rating of each country.
  \item The continent of each country.
\end{itemize}

In order to construct a balanced dataset between countries in the treatment and control groups propensity score matching is used. A random forest model is used to calculate the probability for each country to enter into the treatment group based on all the available variables, yearly variables such as GDP and land area are averaged for each country. Countries with treatment probabilities larger than 97.5% and smaller than 2.5% are removed from the dataset. This process removes 62 countries to leave a dataset of 98 countries across 72 years starting in 1950.

# Methodology 

## LASSO-OLS Model 

The combined use of LASSO for variable selection followed by OLS regression is a well-established methodology in statistical analysis. The foundational work by @tibshirani1996regression introduced the LASSO technique, which performs variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of statistical models. Further research by @belloni2014inference demonstrated that applying OLS after LASSO-based model selection yields estimators with improved properties, such as reduced bias and enhanced convergence rates. This approach is particularly advantageous in high-dimensional settings where the number of potential explanatory variables is large, as it effectively identifies the most relevant predictors and provides reliable estimates of their effects.

The LASSO model is applied to all collected data to determine the importance of the relevant model, the LASSO model is then optimised to provide the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) when predicting the data. This allows me to see which variables are prevalent in the model that estimates emissions the best. An OLS model is then run on these variables to estimate the coefficient of the relevant variables, among them the impact of having a carbon tax as opposed to not having a carbon tax. The following OLS model is adapted to include an lambda term to optimise the LASSO model.

\[
\begin{aligned}
\ln(\text{Emissions}_i) = & \, \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln(\text{GDP per capita}_i) + \beta_2 \ln(\text{Population}_i) \\
& + \beta_3 \ln(\text{Land Area}_i) + \beta_4 \text{HDI Tier}_i \\
& + \beta_5 \text{Continent}_i + \beta_6 \text{Carbon Tax}_i \\
& + \epsilon_i
\end{aligned}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \( \ln(\text{Emissions}_i) \): Log of emissions for country \( i \), the dependent variable.
  \item \( \ln(\text{GDP per capita}_i) \): Log of GDP per capita for country \( i \).
  \item \( \ln(\text{Population}_i) \): Log of population for country \( i \).
  \item \( \ln(\text{Land Area}_i) \): Log of land area for country \( i \).
  \item \( \text{HDI Tier}_i \): Human Development Index tier for country \( i \) (categorical variable).
  \item \( \text{Continent}_i \): Continent of country \( i \) (categorical variable).
  \item \( \text{Carbon Tax}_{\text{Bin}_i} \): Binary variable indicating the presence (\(1\)) or absence (\(0\)) of a carbon tax for country \( i \).
  \item \( \beta_0, \beta_1, ..., \beta_6 \): Coefficients estimated through LASSO-OLS.
  \item \( \epsilon_i \): Error term.
\end{itemize}

The use of the OLS model to calculate the impact of the treatment provides a very efficient model it the respective assumptions hold, however the validity of these assumptions are likely tenuous in this specific context. The assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity and exogeneity of independent variables are unlikely to hold in a model that analyses the complex relationships of taxes and emissions. Therefore, other models are also used to approximate the treatment effect.

## Difference-in-Difference Models

The DiD approach is a widely used econometric method for estimating causal effects by comparing outcomes before and after treatment across treated and untreated groups. This method assumes that, in the absence of treatment, the differences between these groups would remain constant over time (the parallel trends assumption). In the context of this project, a simple DiD model compares emissions changes in countries with active carbon tax policies (treated) to those without such policies (control), before and after the implementation of the tax. The validity of this approach lies in its ability to eliminate time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity that could bias the estimates [@angrist2009mostly]. However, its robustness hinges on the fulfillment of the parallel trends assumption, which must be assessed through graphical inspection or placebo tests to ensure credible inferences. In order to deal with the difference in timing of the policies across countries the series of each country is shifted to relative time to the starting date of the carbon tax. This requires a stricter assumption of parallel trends in the relative time to implementation, if this assumption does not hold it will lead to biased estimates. 

The triple difference, or Difference-in-Difference-in-Differences (DDD), model extends the DiD framework by adding a third dimension to account for heterogeneous treatment effects across groups. This method works by comparing the difference in emissions between treated and untreated countries across development tiers or continents, while simultaneously considering changes over time. For example, it could compare emissions reductions in developed and developing countries with and without carbon taxes, controlling for baseline differences in trends. The DDD approach is particularly useful in this project to test for heterogeneous impacts of carbon taxes, such as whether they are more effective in countries with higher HDI tiers. @bertrand2004much in The Quarterly Journal of Economics discuss the benefits of DDD models in addressing omitted variable bias by introducing an additional layer of control. This robustness makes the approach suitable for capturing nuanced treatment effects across different socio-economic contexts.

A staggered treatment Difference-in-Differences model accommodates cases where treatment is implemented at different times across units, as is common with the adoption of carbon taxes by different countries. This approach modifies the traditional DiD framework to allow for the variation in treatment timing, leveraging countries that adopt the policy later as a control group for earlier adopters. @callaway2021difference provides a rigorous exploration of this methodology, demonstrating its validity for causal inference. In this project, the staggered treatment DiD model allows for a more precise estimation of the effect of carbon taxes on emissions by utilising the timing variation to strengthen identification. It ensures that the dynamic effects of treatment over time are adequately captured, reducing bias and improving the reliability of the estimated treatment effects [@callaway2021difference].

## Causal Forest Model

A causal inference approach provides a robust framework for estimating the treatment effects of carbon taxes on emissions by isolating the causal relationship between policy implementation and observed outcomes. This method leverages techniques such as matching and regression adjustment to control for confounding variables that might otherwise bias the results [@wager2018estimation]. For example, causal inference can account for differences in baseline emissions trends between countries that implement carbon taxes and those that do not, ensuring that the estimated treatment effect reflects the true impact of the policy. According to @wager2018estimation, causal inference methods are critical for establishing credible counterfactuals, which are essential for determining what emissions levels would have been in the absence of the carbon tax. By explicitly modelling the causal pathway, this approach ensures a rigorous evaluation of the policyâ€™s efficacy, offering valuable insights into the extent to which carbon taxes drive emissions reductions.

# Results

## Propensity Score Matching

The random forest model that is used for estimating treatment probabilities has the following hyperparameters:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A minimum node size of 5.
  \item Two random variables are selected as candidates at each split.
  \item A total of 500 trees are used.
  \item 10-fold cross validation to reduce the risk of overfitting.
  \item No limit was set for the maximum tree depth.
\end{itemize}

The distribution of the treatment probabilities for countries can be seen in *Figure 1*. An Epanechnikov kernel is chosen with a bandwidth of 3.5% for both the histogram and kernel density plots. From the plot we can see that the majority of countries have a low probability of entering into treatment. In order to have more comparable control and treatment groups the countries with treatment probabilites below 2.5% are removed, there are no countries with treatment probabilities above 97.5%.

### Figure 1: Distribution of Treatment Probabilities {-}

```

## LASSO-OLS Model

The LASSO model uses the OLS model defined in the methodology section, but adds a lambda penalty term in order to penalise the addition of extra variables. *Figure 2* shows the accuracy of estimation by the OLS model at different levels of lambda. This allows us to look at whether additional variables are subtracting from the efficiency of the OLS model. However, from *Figure 2* we see that the optimal lambda is 0 in this model. All variables decrease the MSE at the optimal level of lambda.

### Figure 2: Accuracy at Different Values of Lambda {-}

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("bin/Opt_Lambda.png")
```

*Figure 3* displays the process of the LASSO model to decrease variable coefficients to zero and inact variable selection. However, at the optimal lambda value all variables are selected, as can be seen by the non-zero coefficients at the red dashed line where the lambda is at its optimal. 

### Figure 3: Coefficients at Different Values of Lambda {-}

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("bin/Coeff_Lambda.png")
```

The LASSO model also allows for the ranking of variable importance in predicting carbon emissions. This ranking of variables is displayed in *Figure 4*. From this plot we can see that whether a carbon tax is active in a country is the fourth most important variable in predicting emissions. Only falling after GDP, population and land area variables. However, this could be due to heterogeneity or exogeneity.

### Figure 4: Variable Importance in LASSO Model {-}

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("bin/VIP_LASSO.png")
```

Using all available variables, as suggested by the LASSO model, I run an OLS model that estimates the impact of each variable on the emissions in each country, these estimates are captured in *Table 1*. 

### Table 1: OLS Model

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("bin/OLS_Tab.png")
```

The importance of the variables, the high number of observations, the efficiency of the OLS model and the complex nature of the emissions function are all possible reasons for all variables being significant at a 99% confidence interval. For the binary variable on whether a carbon tax policy is active in a country we can calculate the exact predicted decrease. This LASSO-OLS model estimates 29.4% lower emissions, on average, in countries with an active carbon tax policy. 

## Difference-in-Difference Models

The main assumption of concern in the simple DiD model is the assumption of parallel trends, this is of specific concern in the context of relative times to policy application. *Figure 5* shows the changes in the dependent variable across time for the control and treatment groups. It is clear that the assumption does not hold prior to the implementation of a carbon tax policy, it should however be noted that the change after the implementation appears visually to be more dramatic than before implementation. 

### Figure 5: Trends in Relative Time for Treatment and Control Groups {-}

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("bin/Par_Trends.png")
```

The estimation of the simple DiD model and the DDD models with development tiers and continents is included in *Table 2*. 

### Table 2: DiD Coefficients Table

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("bin/DID_Tab.png")
```

When the interaction term of the simple DiD model is converted to a percentage of change it suggests a 59.02% decrease in emissions for countries in the treatment group, at the 99% confidence level. However, these estimates are likely to be biased due to a lack of parallel trends and controls. The treatment effect is further explored in the DDD models.

### Figure 6: Parallel Trends of Development Level and Treatment Groups {-}

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("bin/HDI_Trend.png")
```

In the first DDD model I include interactions with a development binary variable (1 when HDI tier is "Very High", 0 if not). *Figure 6* shows the change in parallel trends when this interaction is included. Comparing the treatment (1.0) and control (0.0) groups of lower HDI countries provides more convincing proof of the parallel trends assumption. There is also evidence for the treatment (1.1) and control (0.1) group of highly developed countries over the 35 years prior to implementation.

### Figure 7: Emission Estimation Across Treatment and Development Groups {-}

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("bin/Pred_HDI.png")
```

By combining the coefficients of *Table 2* for the first DDD model I can estimate the predicted level of emissions based on this model. These estimates for each group is shown in *Figure 7*, the bars represent the 95% confidence interval surrounding the estimates. From *Table 2* we can see that the interaction term of the treatment group and the treatment period becomes insignificant and so does the triple difference term. However, the interaction of development group and treatment group is significant at the 99% level. This suggests that the impact of carbon taxes is more pronounced for countries in lower HDI tiers.   

### Figure 8: Parallel Trends of Continent and Treatment Groups {-}

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("bin/Cont_Trend.png")
```

For the second DDD model I include an interaction with the different continents of the countries, this is done in order to control for differences in cultural approaches to climate change across continents. The trends of the emissions between the treatment and control groups for each continent is shown in *Figure 8*. This provides convincing evidence of parallel trends for Africa, Asia and the Americas. However, this assumption does not appear to hold in Europe or Oceania.

### Figure 9: Emission Estimation Across Treatment and Continent Groups {-}

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("bin/Cont_Est.png")
```

*Figure 9* shows the differences between treatment and control groups for different continents, it should be noted how these differences change depending on the relevant continent. From *Table 2* we can see that the emissions of all countries are significantly higher than the reference continent (Africa). The interaction of the treatment group and the post treatment period is not statistically significant, suggesting that once continent has been controlled for there is on average little impact of carbon taxes on emissions. All of the triple interactions terms are also not statistically significant, suggesting that there are not significant differences in the impact of carbon taxes across continents. This model provides evidence of significant differences in emissions between continents and between groups within continents, but little evidence of a causal relationship between carbon taxes and emissions.

## Difference-in-Difference With Staggered Treatment

All previous DiD and DDD models are done in relative time, this could bias our estimates as it does not compare the control and treatment groups within context, in order to take this into account a staggered DiD model is run according to the specification of @callaway2021difference. This model does not allow for countries which switch back to having no carbon tax, for this reason certain countries (such as Australia) are removed. 

### Figure 10: Average Treatment Effect by Length of Exposure {-}

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("bin/Eff_Length.png")
```

*Figure 10* shows the treatment effect of carbon taxes on emission by the length of the period that the country has had a carbon tax policy. However, the 95% confidence interval steadily increases as the number of countries that have data for long periods under carbon tax policies reduces. Despite this we can see that the treatment effect is statistically significant between 23 and 29 years after the implementation of the carbon tax policy. This is likely due to infrastructure and business models only changing in the long term rather than shorter term. 

### Figure 11: Average Treatment Effect by Treatment Group {-}

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("bin/Avg_Grp_Eff.png")
```

*Figure 11* on the hand shows the estimated treatment effect for each cohort of companies that introduce treatment. Due to the sample size of certain groups being very low, not many countries switched those years, the confidence intervals are very wide. Despite this, several years show significant average effects for the treated, these years however seem rather random. Some years such as 1992 and 1993 are significant, but 1991 is not. 2018 is significant, but 2017 and 2019 is not, this could likely be due the specific countries that are included in each group. The estimate of the staggered DiD model is an average treatment effect across groups of -15.09% at the 99% confidence interval.

## Causal Forest Model

The causal forest model is estimated with the following hyperparameters:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A total of 2000 trees.
  \item All 7 variables is observed at each split in the trees.
  \item 50% of the sample, with replacement, is randomly selected for each tree.
  \item A minimum node size of 5 observations.
  \item 5% of impbalance is allowed between the control and treatment groups.
\end{itemize}

Observation specific treatment effects can then be estimated, the density of these observation specific treatment effects is then plotted in *Figure 12*. An Epanechnikov kernel is chosen for the density plot, while both the kernel density and histogram use a bandwidth of 0.01. In *Figure 12* we can see a significant section of the density plot being to the right of the zero treatment effect line. This suggests that there is significant heterogeneity in the impact of treatment between observations.  

### Figure 12: Distribution of Observation Treatment Effects {-}

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("bin/Causal_Eff_Dist.png")
```

The marked difference in distribution between the treatment and control group can be seen in *Figure 13*. The causal forest model estimates the average treatment effect of carbon taxes across all observations to be a 3.91% decrease in emissions. However, as can be seen from *Figure 12* and *Figure 13* this is very dependent on the specfic observation. This reinforces the findings of the DDD and staggered treatment models that the impact of treatment differs significantly across countries and time periods.
